# 奇迹男孩 Wonder (2017)


Greatness lies not in being strong, but in the right of using strength. He or she is the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the atrraction of his own.

Maybe if we knew what other people what they were thinking, we'd konw that no one's ordinary. And we all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives. My firends do. My teacher do. My sister does for always being there for me. My dad does for always making us laugh. And my mon does the most for never giving up on anything, especially, me.

It's like that last precept Mr Browne gave us.
Be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. And if you really wanna see what  people are, all you have to do is look.
