# Movie Notes
This repository will be notes from movies that I had watched and touched me a lot. I think movies is a form of art which extract something essential into a few hours.

Some brings us happy and joy, some make us thinking through what actually we do really care about. If you love great movies like me, please help me get them straight.

Lastly, enjoy your movies.
